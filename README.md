# Pinboard Viewer

## Intro
Make Pinboard (http://pinboard.in) pins act more like browser bookmarks. Includes fuzzy search by pin title and url.
Click the button or use a keyboard shortcut (see below) to bring up your Pinboard bookmarks. Search for tag names to filter, or search for a page title or URL to find a specific bookmark.

The results update as you type. Once you've found your bookmark, press Enter or Tab to open it. Hold `Cmd` (Mac) or `Ctrl` (Windows) to open it in a new tab.

## Keyboard shortcut 

You can set keyboard shortcuts for all your extensions right in Chrome (or any Chrome based browser, like e.g. [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com)).
Just open the extension manager (three dots in the upper right, more tools, extensions) and hit the *hamburger menu* button in the upper left. There, you can find the *keyboard shortcuts* option. 

Suggested shortcut: `Cmd-Shift-P` or `Ctrl-Shift-P` 

Make sure you haven't assigned the same shortcut to multiple extensions.
